## Weak Points & Areas for Improvement

### ⚠️ Potential Issues

1. **Complexity for MVP**
   - **Issue**: Full microservices architecture may be over-engineering for 5K users
   - **Recommendation**: Consider starting with a modular monolith and extracting services as needed
   - **Alternative**: Deploy only Recipe Service + Parser + Enrichment initially, keep others as modules

2. **Parser Service Legal Risks**
   - **Issue**: Web scraping may violate ToS of recipe sites
   - **Recommendation**:
     - Consult with legal team before deploying Parser
     - Focus on sites with explicit API or open data
     - Implement strict robots.txt compliance
     - Consider partnerships with recipe sites instead

3. **AI Service Costs**
   - **Issue**: OpenAI API costs can be high with unlimited Premium users
   - **Recommendation**:
     - Implement strict rate limiting (even for Premium)
     - Cache common queries
     - Use smaller models for simple questions
     - Consider self-hosted models for basic recommendations

4. **Database Sharding Premature**
   - **Issue**: ClickHouse sharding mentioned but not needed for MVP volumes
   - **Recommendation**: Start with single ClickHouse node, shard only when reaching 10M+ events/day

5. **Missing Error Scenarios**
   - **Issue**: Sequence diagrams mostly show happy paths
   - **Recommendation**: Document error handling flows (API failures, timeouts, validation errors)

6. **Internationalization Over-Scoped**
   - **Issue**: Multiple language support mentioned but not critical for MVP
   - **Recommendation**: Focus on Russian only for MVP, add English in Phase 2

7. **Payment Integration** ✅ **FIXED**
   - **Updated**: Now using only YooKassa (best Russian market support)
   - **Rationale**: Simplifies integration, reduces complexity, lower costs

8. **Monitoring Stack Heavy**
   - **Issue**: ELK + Prometheus + Grafana + Sentry is a lot for MVP
   - **Recommendation**:
     - MVP: Sentry (errors) + Cloud-native logs (CloudWatch/Yandex Cloud Logging)
     - Phase 2: Add Prometheus + Grafana
     - Phase 3: Consider ELK if truly needed

9. **Meal Planning Algorithm Undefined**
   - **Issue**: "Linear programming or greedy algorithm" is vague
   - **Recommendation**:
     - Specify exact algorithm (e.g., Branch & Bound, Genetic Algorithm)
     - Define constraints formally (hard vs soft constraints)
     - Create a separate technical design doc for this component

10. **B2B Integration Assumptions**
    - **Issue**: Assumes APIs exist for all retailers (X5, VkusVill, etc.)
    - **Reality Check**: Many retailers don't have public APIs
    - **Recommendation**:
      - Start with one retailer pilot (sign agreement first)
      - Be prepared for custom integrations or manual processes initially

11. **User Profile Complexity**
    - **Issue**: Many optional fields may lead to incomplete data
    - **Recommendation**:
      - Progressive disclosure: collect data over time
      - Incentivize profile completion (better recommendations)
      - A/B test: mandatory vs optional fields

12. **Video Parsing Overly Ambitious**
    - **Issue**: Extracting recipes from TikTok/YouTube videos is complex and expensive
    - **Recommendation**:
      - De-prioritize for MVP
      - Start with metadata only (title, description)
      - Consider manual curation instead of automated extraction

---

## Specific Recommendations

### 1. MVP Simplification (Months 1-3)

**Phase 1A: Core MVP** (Deploy in 6-8 weeks):
- Recipe Service with basic CRUD
- Simple web scraper (manual trigger, not automated)
- Manual data enrichment (hire temp workers to input KBJU)
- Basic analytics (Google Analytics only)
- User auth via email only (no OAuth)
- PostgreSQL + Redis only (no ClickHouse yet)

**Phase 1B: Enhanced MVP** (Weeks 9-16):
- Automated parser with scheduler
- ML-based KBJU calculation
- OAuth providers (Yandex ID, VK ID)
- Custom analytics service (start collecting events)
- Basic recommendations (content-based filtering)

**Phase 1C: Premium Features** (Weeks 17-24):
- AI Nutritionist integration
- Meal planning (simple greedy algorithm)
- Payment integration (YooKassa)
- Premium subscriptions launch

### 2. Technology Stack Adjustments

**Instead of**:
- Full microservices from day 1

**Consider**:
- Modular monolith (NestJS) with clear module boundaries
- Extract to microservices when:
  - Service needs independent scaling (Parser, AI)
  - Team size grows (separate teams per service)
  - Different tech stack required (Python for ML)

**Benefits**:
- Faster initial development
- Simpler deployment
- Easier debugging
- Lower infrastructure costs

### 3. Data Strategy

**Prioritize**:
1. **Quality over quantity**: Start with 1,000 high-quality recipes (manually curated) instead of 10,000 scraped
2. **Partnerships**: Reach out to food bloggers for content partnerships (legal + quality)
3. **UGC incentives**: Gamify recipe submission by users (later phase)

**KBJU Data**:
- License existing food databases (USDA is free, but check RU alternatives)
- Consider partnership with nutritionists for data validation
- Clearly mark estimated vs validated KBJU

### 4. Go-to-Market Strategy

**Pre-Launch** (Month 0):
- Build landing page with email signup
- Target: 500 email signups before launch
- Run ads to gauge interest and CAC

**Launch** (Month 1):
- Invite-only beta (first 100 users)
- Iterate based on feedback
- Fix critical bugs before public launch

**Growth** (Months 2-6):
- SEO optimization (recipe pages are great for SEO)
- Content marketing (blog with nutrition tips)
- Partnership with fitness influencers
- Referral program (both users get 1 month Premium)

### 5. Metrics Dashboard Priorities

**Week 1 Metrics** (must have):
- User signups per day
- Active users (DAU)
- Recipe views per user
- Top viewed recipes

**Month 1 Metrics** (add):
- Retention D1, D7
- Conversion to registered users
- Search queries (popular terms)
- Error rate

**Month 3 Metrics** (add):
- Retention D30
- Conversion to Premium
- ARPU, LTV
- NPS (Net Promoter Score)

### 6. Team & Roles (Initial)

**Minimal Viable Team** (Pre-seed):
1. **You** (Full-stack developer + Product)
2. **Backend Developer** (Node.js, Python)
3. **Frontend Developer** (React, React Native)
4. **Part-time Designer** (UI/UX)
5. **Part-time Content Manager** (Recipe curation)

**Total cost estimate**:
- Founders equity + 2 FTE salaries (~200K ₽/month total)
- 6 months = 1.2M ₽ (fits in 1-2M Pre-seed budget)

### 7. Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Legal issues with scraping | Medium | High | Start with partnerships, not scraping |
| Low user engagement | Medium | Critical | Extensive user testing before launch |
| High AI API costs | High | Medium | Strict rate limiting, caching |
| Competition from Yandex/VK | Low | Critical | Move fast, build community |
| KBJU calculation errors | Medium | Medium | Manual validation, user reports |
| Payment gateway issues | Low | High | Thorough testing, fallback provider |
